### Namelist App
I originally created this app for a purpose identical to [ChapterBuilder](https://chapterbuilder.com/) but for my own professional enviornmental fraternity [Epsilon Eta](https://epsilonetaucberkeley.com/). I abandoned project development once I realized there was a far more complete version available, but not before I the basics working!

### Features:
- Serverless implementation using [AWS amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) for essentially infinite scalability
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) + [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) front end for a clean user experience while minimizing development time. 
- Secure login handled through [AWS cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html), and speedy database delivered with [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)

### Installation:
Installation isn't possible on another host because I am unwilling to share my amazon AWS credentials online. Downloading this and running `nmp start` will only give a login page that will not work.

### Take away
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with as many different commercial technologies as possible. I began with a more classic backend hosted by Node.js but wanted to dive into AWS. I successfully created a CRUD app with amplify and feel comfortable using many AWS services. I'm also now quite familiar with React.js and Material UI.
